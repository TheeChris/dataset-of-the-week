# Dataset of the Week
<img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2SpYDOZmp3H2cAAo/giphy.gif' align="right" width="240px"/>I decided to embark on this project is that I wanted to iteratively fine-tune my exploratory process while getting to examine data that I had never seen before. I wanted to be able to explore the data to see where curiosity takes me. I will keep the rules simple. Every(ish) week I will:

1. spend at least one hour exploring a dataset I have never seen before.
1. publish the notebooks on GitHub
1. write and publish a brief summary of what I learned each week

I won't make it a rule, but I'm going to try my best not to repeat categories. This means that I will try to pick a datasets from a variety of categories (e.g. politics, environment, biology, media, etc). This should not only challenge me, but also make it more interesting for all of us.
