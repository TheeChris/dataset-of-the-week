# Dataset of the Week
<img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2SpYDOZmp3H2cAAo/giphy.gif' align="right" width="240px"/>I decided to embark on this project because I wanted to iteratively fine-tune my exploratory process while getting to examine data that I had never seen before. I wanted to be able to explore the data to see where curiosity takes me. I will keep the rules simple. I will:

1. spend at least one hour exploring a dataset I have never seen before.
1. publish the notebooks on GitHub
1. write and publish a brief summary of what I learned each week

I won't make it a rule, but I'm going to try my best not to repeat categories. This means that I will try to pick a datasets from a variety of categories (e.g. politics, environment, biology, media, etc). This should not only challenge me, but also make it more interesting for all of us. Although it is called "dataset of the week", I don't plan to do this every week. I have to many other side projects and family/friend/work responsibilities to make that promise. But I will try to keep it weekly-ish for at least the first month or two.
